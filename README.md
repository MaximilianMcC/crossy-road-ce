# Crossy Road CE
A simplified version of the game [crossy road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road) made for the TI 84 Plus CE graphing calculator. This project is also being used for NCEA Level 3 DTS. You can view the project management side of it [here](https://github.com/users/MaximilianMcC/projects/4).

## Project versions
The end goal is to get a game that looks like crossy road. Because I only have basically a week to create this, I will first be creating it in 2D. In the second version of this game I will be including isometric graphics. This first version is simple 2D top down, however this is temporary.

## Notes and stuff for when I'm developing
- Run `make` for normal compiling
- Run `make debug` for compiling with debugging features like CEmu console
- Run `make gfx` to convert graphics to binary
- To make a part of an image make the part that you want transparent `#ff0080`/`255, 0, 128`
